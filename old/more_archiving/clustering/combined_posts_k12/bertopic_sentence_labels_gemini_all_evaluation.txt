The clusters exhibit significant overlap, particularly between "Topic 1: Miscellaneous AI experiences, thoughts, and observations" and "Topic 2: Miscellaneous observations about AI and unrelated topics." The differentiation between "Topic 3: Anecdotal AI capabilities observations and OpenAI rumors" and other topics is also weak. With such broad and overlapping labels, four clusters are likely too many. A more effective clustering might consolidate similar topics, potentially aiming for two or three more distinct themes.
