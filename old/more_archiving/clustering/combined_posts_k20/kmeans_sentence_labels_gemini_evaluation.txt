The clusters appear somewhat granular, with overlap in themes related to AI errors and limitations. For example, clusters 1, 2, 4, 7, 14, 16, and 17 all touch on different facets of AI failures. The total number of clusters (20) seems high and could likely be reduced by merging related topics. An optimal number of clusters might be closer to 10-12 by consolidating similar error types and AI usage contexts.
