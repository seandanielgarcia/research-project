The clusters exhibit some thematic overlap. For example, clusters 1, 2, 4, 7, and 9 all touch on AI failures or unexpected behaviors. The current 12 clusters seems somewhat excessive, suggesting the data is being over-segmented. A more optimal clustering might involve consolidating similar error types and limitations, as well as career guidance and emotional support themes. Around 6–8 clusters might provide a better balance between granularity and generalizability.
