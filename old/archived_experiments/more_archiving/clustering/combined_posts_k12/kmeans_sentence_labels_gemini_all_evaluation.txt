The clusters exhibit significant overlap, particularly those concerning AI/ChatGPT limitations and errors (Clusters 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9, and 10). The number of clusters (12) seems excessive given these redundancies, suggesting an overly granular division of topics.  Clusters 8 (AI as companion) stands out as distinct. An optimal number of clusters would likely be between 5 and 7, consolidating the error/limitation themes and keeping the companion theme separate.
