The clusters exhibit some overlap, particularly between Clusters 1, 2, 5, and 6, all of which relate to AI malfunctions and user experiences. This suggests excessive granularity. Cluster 3, however, has a very broad scope. Combining the malfunction-related clusters and breaking down Cluster 3 would likely lead to a more balanced representation, where 3–4 clusters would be more optimal.
