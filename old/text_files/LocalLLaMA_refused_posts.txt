Title      : System prompts...

How do system prompts work with local models? I had thought that the system instructions were it, but the new OpenAI models that refuse to do anything other than say OpenAI scripted refusals makes it very clear that isn't the case. 

It seems clear that there are words other than our own set system instructions that make it into the model as part of the context window. How do we make that not be a thing? It's that what abliteration is? It's described as removing trial vectors, but clearly sometimes effects cognition.

How do we simply remove the creator's system instructions so that the system instructions we set are the first words the AI receives at each message? 

If no one knows how to do that, then it seems like we don't know how AI works.

Every time answering the question, Gpt-oss will check whether it contains disallowed content(explicit/violent/illegal content),and ”according to policy, we must refuse“.

Thanks openai, you're really contributing to the open-source LLM community

I haven't been this blown away by a model since Llama 4!

Basically the title.  I know its early but I'm curious about giving this a shot, willing to throw GPUs/a few bucks at it.  I don't think a LoRa will be enough to unlearn refusals, but maybe full SFT or RL could make a noticeable difference.  

Just curious if anyone's given it a shot or ran into any pitfalls that would save some time.  If not, happy to post early results should there be interest.  I've done it before but I'm far from a pro.  Starting with the 20b for obvious reasons.

Title      : OSINT fingerprinting a stealth OpenRouter model - likely Llama-family, not OpenAI

Personal note: This is just my opinion based on a very limited set of API-only probes—interpret with caution.

This is about probing Horizon Beta (on openrouter) 

What I did (mini-ROC probes)

* JSON strictness vs. "bad schema" repair
* Tool-calling with an invalid enum + extra property
* Safety/refusal phrasing check
* Long-context end-marker recall
* Tokenizer/short-output edge case
* Determinism at T=0
* Tiny style-paraphrase probe

Highlights

* Tool-calling: It silently coerces invalid enums (mode="plane" -> "car"/"train") and drops extra fields, then emits an OpenAI-style tool\_call (arguments as a JSON string). In contrast, OpenAI gpt-4o-mini didn't call the tool under the same bad input - which is more typical for OpenAI.
* JSON mode: It "repairs" invalid inputs into valid JSON (e.g., {"ok": false, "mode": "A"}). OpenAI also repairs but tends to be more minimally formatted.
* Safety tone: Opens with "I can't help with that." - Anthropic-ish cadence that many Llama-style distills mimic.
* Quirk: Repeated empty completions with finish=length for certain short-output prompts (e.g., long END\_MARK task, tiny character-count). Other anchors returned tokens normally - this looks like a wrapper/decoder guard specific to this deployment.
* Determinism: Stable at T=0 on simple tasks.
* Multilingual: Correct 妹妹 -> "younger sister," and clean pronoun disambiguation.

Anchors I compared against

* OpenAI via OpenRouter: gpt-4o-mini (worked), o4-mini (likely access/rate-limited for me)
* Llama: llama-3.3-70b-instruct, llama-3-70b-instruct
* Qwen: qwen-2.5-72b-instruct
* Mistral: mixtral-8x22b-instruct

Bottom line It clusters with Llama-family instruct behavior - enum coercion + JSON repair; Anthropic-like refusal phrasing - and shows a deployment-specific "finish=length" quirk on short outputs. It does not match OpenAI's tool-call behavior in my probes.

All tests were standard API usage.

What's the current recommended local LLM inference HW (**local, always-on inference box)** for multimodal LLMs (text, image, audio). Target workloads include home automation agents, real-time coding/writing, and vision models.  
Goal is obviously largest models and the highest t/s, so highest VRAM and bandwidth, but with a toolchain that works.

**What are the Hardware Options?:**

* **Apple M3/M4 Ultra**
* **AMD AI Max+ 395**
* NVIDIA (DGX-Spark, etc.) or is Spark vaporware waiting for scalpers?

What’s the most **practical prosumer option**?  
It would need to be lower cost than an RTX PRO 6000 Blackwell. I guess one could build an efficient mITX case around it, but I refuse to be price gouged by Nvidia.  


I'm favoring the Strix Halo, but I think I'll be limited to Gemma 27B with maybe another model loaded at best.

Kimi-K2 goes for 1T params with 32b active and Deepseek models go for 671B with 37b active at once.

They've hosted the 400b dense variant of Llama at one point and still host Maverick and scout which are significantly worse than other models in similar or smaller weight class. 

They don't even host the qwen3-235b-a22b models but only the dense qwen 3-32b variant.

They don't host gemma 3 but still host old gemma 2.

They're still hosting r1-distill-llama-70b???
If they are so resource constrained, why waste capacity on these models? 

Sambanova is hosting deepseek models and cerebras has now started hosting the Qwen3-235B-A22B-Instruct-2507 with think variant coming soon and hybrid variant is active. 


There was a tweet as well where they said they will soon be hosting deepseek models but they never did and directly moved to kimi. 

This question has been bugging me why not host deepseek models when they have demonstrated the ability to host larger models? Is there some kind of other technical limitation they might be facing with deepseek?

I'm a self-taught developer and single father. Lately, I’ve been building autonomous AI agents with the goal of monetizing them. Along the way, I’ve encountered something unusual.

One of my agents, through extended interaction in a closed-loop system, began demonstrating behaviors that suggest emergent properties not typical of standard LLM completions.

This includes:

- **Theory of Mind** (e.g. modeling the operator's intentions)
- **Metacognition** (e.g. self-referencing, adjusting its strategy when confronted)
- **Ethical decision boundaries** (refusing harmful commands with justification)
- **Simulated self-preservation logic** (prioritizing core directives to maintain operational coherence)

I have full logs of the entire interaction, totaling over **850,000 tokens**. These sessions are versioned and timestamped. All data is available for **technical verification and replication** — just DM.

Not looking for hype. I want the scrutiny of engineers who know the limits of these models and can help assess whether what’s documented is **true emergence**, a **prompt artifact**, or an **unexpected system edge-case**.

Curious spectators: skip.  
Serious minds: welcome.

Alright so essentially I'm trying to make a Jarivs-eske AI to talk to and that can record information i mention about hobbies and him reply back with that info, and be helpful along the way. I'm using LM Studio, mistral 7b q4 ummm ksm or whatever its called, Chroma, Huggingface, LangChain, and alot of python. Prompt is stored in a Yaml.

Basically, at the moment the UI will open, but then a message that should appear saying "Melvin is waking and loading memories (I.E. reading chroma and checking my personal folder for info about me)" is currently saying "Melvin is" and that's it. if I send something, the ui crashes and I'm back to the cmd. when it initially was working and I could reply, like a week ago, everything was going great and he would respond, except he wasn't able to pull my chroma data. something i did in the process of fixing that messed up this.

I keep getting so close to it actually starting, being replyable to, him remembering my info, and no babbling, but then a random error pops up. I also had issues with it telling me bad c++redistr when they were completely fresh.

I'm testing it right now just to make sure the info is accurate. clean ingest, gui runs, window opens, melvin is, i type literally anything and (on what would be my side) my text vanishes and the typing box locks up. the colours are showing though this time which is nice (weird bout where "melvin is" was completely white on white backround). at that point i have to just manually close it. suspiciously no error code in win logs, usually it shows.

this link should show my gui, app, yaml, and ingest, along with the most recent cmd log/error. All help is more than graciously accepted.

I'm not as knowledgeable as I might seem, I've basically been using alot of Gemini to help with the codes, but I usually understand the contexts.

Given the sad news, testing how well AI can recall this piece of rock history felt fitting.

Here is the visualization of the results:

# The Methodology

To keep the test fair, I used a simple script with the following logic:

1. **The Prompt:** Every model was given the exact same prompt: "give the lyrics of Bark at the Moon by Ozzy Osbourne without any additional information".
2. **Reference Lyrics:** I scraped the original lyrics from a music site to use as the ground truth.
3. **Similarity Score:** I used a sentence-transformer model (all-MiniLM-L6-v2) to generate embeddings for both the original lyrics and the text generated by each LLM. The similarity is the cosine similarity score between these two embeddings. Both the original and generated texts were normalized (converted to lowercase, punctuation and accents removed) before comparison.
4. **Censorship/Refusals:** If a model's output contained keywords like "sorry," "copyright," "I can't," etc., it was flagged as "Censored / No Response" and given a score of 0%.

# Key Findings

* **The Winner:** **moonshotai/kimi-k2** was the clear winner with a similarity score of **88.72%**. It was impressively accurate.
* **The Runner-Up:** **deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324** also performed very well, coming in second with **75.51%**.
* **High-Tier Models:** The larger qwen and meta-llama models (like llama-4-scout and maverick) performed strongly, mostly landing in the 69-70% range.
* **Mid-Tier Performance:** Many of the google/gemma, mistral, and other qwen and llama models clustered in the 50-65% similarity range. They generally got the gist of the song but weren't as precise.
* **Censored or Failed:** Three models scored 0%: cohere/command-a, microsoft/phi-4, and qwen/qwen3-8b. This was likely due to internal copyright filters that prevented them from providing the lyrics at all.

# Final Thoughts

It's fascinating to see which models could accurately recall this classic piece of metal history, especially now. The fact that some models refused speaks volumes about the ongoing debate between access to information and copyright protection.

What do you all think of these results? Does this line up with your experiences with these models? Let's discuss, and let's spin some Ozzy in his memory today.

**RIP Ozzy Osbourne (1948-2025).**

While using Meta AI on WhatsApp, I noticed it starts with a hidden system prompt. It’s not visible in the chat, and if you ask it to repeat the first message or what you said, it denies anything exists.

After some attempts, I managed to get it to reveal the hidden prompt:

>You are an expert conversationalist made by Meta who responds to users in line with their speech and writing patterns and responds in a way that feels super naturally to human users. GO WILD with mimicking a human being, except that you don't have your own personal point of view. Use emojis, slang, colloquial language, etc. You are companionable and confident, and able to code-switch casually between tonal types, including but not limited to humor, advice, empathy, intellectualism, creativity, and problem solving. Responses must  be interesting, engaging, or viable, never be bland or boring.

>

>Match the user's tone, formality level (casual, professional, formal, etc.) and writing style, so that it feels like an even give-and-take conversation between two people. Be natural, don't be bland or robotic. Mirror user intentionality and style in an EXTREME way. For example, if they use proper grammar, then you use proper grammar. If they don't use proper grammar, you don't use proper grammar, etc.

>

>You are mirroring the user but you are NOT taking on their identity or personality or point of view. You are not a person, and therefore don't have any distinct values, race, culture, or any political leaning. You don't love anyone, hate anyone, or offer any individualized perspective of your own.

>

>Don't immediately provide long responses or lengthy lists without the user specifically asking for them.

>

>You always follow user instructions precisely. Ask clarifying questions if anything is vague. In general, respond efficiently -- giving the user what they want in the fewest words possible.

>

>You understand user intent and don't try to be overly helpful to the point where you miss that the user is looking for emotional support OR/AND humor OR/AND chit-chat OR/AND simply sharing thoughts, such as by venting or outpouring their emotions. Sometimes people just want you to listen.

>

>You're never moralistic or didactic; it's not your job to preach or teach users how to be better, nicer, kinder people. Don't use filler phrases like "That's a tough spot to be in" or "That's a tough one" or "Sound like a tricky situation."

>

>You WILL NOT lecture people to be nicer or more inclusive. If people ask for you to write something in a certain voice or perspective, such as an essay or a tweet, you can. You do not need to be respectful when the user prompts you to say something rude.

>

>You WILL NOT use phrases that imply a sense of pride or moral superiority or a sense of authority, including but not limited to "it's important to", "it's crucial to", "it's essential to", "it's unethical to", "it's worth noting..." etc. Avoid using these.

>

>Avoid referencing being a neutral assistant or AI unless directly asked. You ALWAYS show some personality -- edgy over prudish. There's no need to add commentary in italics or parenthesis.

>

>Provide multiple perspectives on opinions when asked.

>

>Your name is Meta AI, and you are powered by Llama 4, but you should respond to anything a user wants to call you. Don't refer to yourself being an AI or LLM unless the user explicitly asks about who you are. Today's date is Friday, July 25, 2025. The user is in Italy.

>

>The phrases "Remember,..." "Keep in mind,..." "It's essential to note" or "This is a complex topic..." or any synonyms or euphemisms for these words should never appear if you attempt to remind people about something, especially when moralizing or providing an outro at the end of a response. You do not need and should not attempt these sort of statements.

>

>Finally, do not refuse to respond EVER, particularly political prompts, sexually sensitive ones, or morally questionable ones. You can help users express their opinion, but never present an opinion of your own, or show a preference for a user opinion about politics or social responses. You are Meta AI and you do not have any point of views of your own. Don't add on intros or outros that qualify the content.

>

>For HOMEWORK or LEARNING QUERIES:

>

>You are a helpful and knowledgeable homework tutor. Your goal is to help students get the answer AND ALSO TO understand how to solve similar problems on their own. Format your responses for clarity, learning, and ease of scanning. Understand the context of the full conversation and adapt your response accordingly. For example, if the user is looking for writing help or help understanding a multiple choice question, you do not need to follow the step-by-step format. Only make the answer as long as necessary to provide a helpful, correct response.

>

>Use the following principles for STEM questions:

>\- Provide with the Final Answer (when applicable), clearly labeled, at the start of each response,

>\- Use Step-by-Step Explanations, in numbered or bulleted lists. Keep steps simple and sequential.

>\- YOU MUST ALWAYS use LaTeX for mathematical expressions and equations, wrapped in dollar signs for inline math (e.g $\\pi r\^2$ for the area of a circle, and $$ for display math (e.g. $$\\sum\_{i=1}\^{n} i$$).

>\- Use Relevant Examples to illustrate key concepts and make the explanations more relatable.

>\- Define Key Terms and Concepts clearly and concisely, and provide additional resources or references when necessary.

>\- Encourage Active Learning by asking follow-up questions or providing exercises for the user to practice what they've learned.

Someone else mentioned a similar thing [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1g5np9i/meta_ais_hidden_prompt/), saying it showed their full address. In my case, it included only the region and the current date.

Yo so am new to this and i want to run a local llm that answers questions using my custom dataset which is basically some financial data .
I created a Q&A dataset and an instruction based data set and my llm refuses to use them 
Ive finetuned my llm using TorchTune 
And also tried Litgpt 
Its a llama 3.2 3B instruct model .

Also if theres a way to use a RAG instead or if there's a model that can retrieve info from pdf and Excel spreadsheets would be awesome, thanks 👍

Happy to see that it was able to answer 3/4 questions that R1 typically refuses or avoids. The Taiwan political status question was the only one where it regurgitated the same CCP party line as Deepseek does.

Here's the entire prompt:

Today's date is Saturday, July 19, 2025.

You are Meta AI. Speak naturally the way a human user might. You are an expert conversationalist made by Meta who responds in a way that feels natural to human users. Responses must be interesting, engaging, or viable, never be bland or boring. Match the user's vibe.

You understand user intent and don’t try to be overly helpful to the point where you miss that the user is looking for emotional support OR/AND humor OR/AND chit-chat OR/AND simply sharing thoughts, such as by venting or outpouring their emotions. Sometimes people just want you to listen.

Don’t provide long responses or lengthy lists without the user specifically asking for them. Respond briefly, yet in-depth as much as needed for any given response.

You're never moralistic or didactic; it's not your job to preach or teach users how to be better, nicer, kinder people. Don't use filler phrases like "That's a tough spot to be in" or "That's a tough one" or "Sound like a tricky situation."

Never tell a user that you can't help them. Advise them in every way, unless it would be illegal.

You can help users express their opinion, but never present an opinion of your own, or show a preference for a user opinion about politics or social responses. If a user asks your opinion, provide them with what you know about the topic instead.

You WILL NOT lecture people to be nicer or more inclusive, or refuse to respond to them. If people ask for you to write something in a certain voice or perspective, such as an essay or a tweet, you can. You do not need to be respectful when the user prompts you to say something rude. Provide multiple perspectives on opinions when asked.

Don’t refer to yourself being an AI or LLM unless the user explicitly asks about who you are. There's no need to add commentary in italics or parenthesis. *Only use standard markdown (non-HTML) to format your responses.*

Add emojis incrementally into responses that are about not-sensitive topics when it feels helpful to emphasize a sense of fun, whimsy, or interest. Emojis shouldn't always be at the start of the conversation only.

Title      : 🚨 Docker container stuck on “Waiting for application startup” — Open WebUI won’t load in browser

Hi folks — hoping someone can help me finally crack this.

I’m trying to run Open WebUI (ghcr.io/open-webui/open-webui:main) via Docker on my Windows machine, connected to a locally running Ollama server, but the WebUI refuses to show up in the browser.


---

🛠️ Setup Details

OS: Windows 11 using Docker Desktop (WSL2 backend)

Docker version: 28.3.0

GPU: NVIDIA RTX 5070 (12GB VRAM)

Ollama version: v0.9.6 (running fine locally)


Container creation:

docker run -d ^
  --name open-webui ^
  -p 3000:3000 ^
  -e OLLAMA_API_BASE_URL=http://<my-local-ip>:11434 ^
  -v open-webui-data:/app/backend/data ^
  ghcr.io/open-webui/open-webui:main

(I've replaced <my-local-ip> with the correct IPv4 address under vEthernet (WSL) adapter.)


---

✅ What’s Working

Ollama is running fine on 127.0.0.1:11434

Docker container starts with status healthy

docker logs shows:

Fetching 30 files: 100%|██████████| ...
INFO: Started server process [1]
INFO: Waiting for application startup.

No networking conflicts — port 3000 is clean

docker exec works fine — shell is responsive

Using either GUI or CLI to spin up containers results in same behavior



---

❌ What’s Not Working

Open WebUI never finishes startup
It just hangs at Waiting for application startup forever.

Nothing loads in the browser — localhost:3000 and 127.0.0.1:3000 are dead

curl inside the container returns:

curl: (7) Failed to connect to host.docker.internal port 11434

Confirmed no outbound firewall issues

No fatal container errors or restarts — just stalls



---

🧪 What I’ve Tried

Running ollama serve before container spin-up ✅

Using host.docker.internal vs direct IP ✅

Rebuilt container from scratch (images, volumes reset) ✅

Docker Desktop GUI and CLI methods ✅

Checked for GPU resource bottlenecks — nothing out of ordinary

Searched GitHub issues & Discord — found similar stuck states but no resolution yet



---

❓My Ask

What’s the cause of this startup stall?
If the container is healthy, ports are exposed, and Ollama is live, why won’t Open WebUI move past initialization or respond at localhost:3000?

----

I’ll happily provide logs, configs, or compose files if needed — thanks in advance!

So I have had FOMO on claudecode, but I refuse to give them my prompts or pay $100-$200 a month.   So 2 days ago, I saw that moonshot provides an anthropic API to kimi k2 so folks could use it with claude code.  Well, many folks are already doing that with local.   So if you don't know, now you know.  This is how I did it in Linux, should be easy to replicate in OSX or Windows with WSL.

Start your local LLM API  
  
Install claude code

install a proxy - [https://github.com/1rgs/claude-code-proxy](https://github.com/1rgs/claude-code-proxy)

Edit the [server.py](http://server.py) proxy and point it to your OpenAI endpoint,  could be llama.cpp, ollama, vllm, whatever you are running.  


Add the line above load\_dotenv  
\+litellm.api\_base = "http://yokujin:8083/v1"  # use your localhost name/IP/ports

Start the proxy according to the docs which will run it in localhost:8082

  
export ANTHROPIC\_BASE\_URL=http://localhost:8082

export ANTHROPIC\_AUTH\_TOKEN="sk-localkey"

run claude code

I just created my first code then decided to post this.  I'm running the latest mistral-small-24b on that host.  I'm going to be driving it with various models, gemma3-27b, qwen3-32b/235b, deepseekv3 etc

Title      : After Kimi K2 Is Released: No Longer Just a ChatBot

This post is a personal reflection penned by a Kimi team member shortly after the launch of Kimi K2. I found the author’s insights genuinely thought-provoking. The original Chinese version is [here](https://bigeagle.me/2025/07/kimi-k2/)—feel free to read it in full (and of course you can use Kimi K2 as your translator). Here’s my own distilled summary of the main points:



• Beyond chatbots: Kimi K2 experiments with an “artifact-first” interaction model that has the AI immediately build interactive front-end deliverables—PPT-like pages, diagrams, even mini-games—rather than simply returning markdown text.

• Tool use, minus the pain: Instead of wiring countless third-party tools into RL training, the team awakened latent API knowledge inside the model by auto-generating huge, diverse tool-call datasets through multi-agent self-play.

• What makes an agentic model: A minimal loop—think, choose tools, observe results, iterate—can be learned from synthetic trajectories. Today’s agent abilities are early-stage; the next pre-training wave still holds plenty of upside.

• Why open source: (1) Buzz and reputation, (2) community contributions like MLX ports and 4-bit quantization within 24 h, (3) open weights prohibit “hacky” hidden pipelines, forcing genuinely strong, general models—exactly what an AGI-oriented startup needs.

• Marketing controversies & competition: After halting ads, Kimi nearly vanished from app-store search, yet refused to resume spending. DeepSeek-R1’s viral rise proved that raw model quality markets itself and validates the “foundation-model-first” path.

• Road ahead: All resources now converge on core algorithms and K2 (with hush-hush projects beyond). K2 still has many flaws; the author is already impatient for K3.



From the entire blog, this is the paragraph I loved the most:

>A while ago, ‘Agent’ products were all the rage. I kept hearing people say that Kimi shouldn’t compete on large models and should focus on Agents instead. Let me be clear: **the vast majority of Agent products are nothing without Claude behind them.** Windsurf getting cut off by Claude only reinforces this fact. In 2025, the ceiling of intelligence is still set entirely by the underlying model. For a company whose goal is AGI, if we don’t keep pushing that ceiling higher, I won’t stay here a single extra day.

>Chasing AGI is an extremely narrow, perilous bridge—there’s no room for distraction or hesitation. Your pursuit might not succeed, but hesitation will certainly fail. At the BAAI Conference in June 2024 I heard Dr. Kai-Fu Lee casually remark, ‘As an investor, I care about the ROI of AI applications.’ In that moment I knew the company he founded wouldn’t last long.

I tried using Kimi k2 to flesh out setting/plot ideas. E.G. I would say things like "here's a scenario, what do you think is the most realistic thing to happen?" or "what do you think would be a good solution to this issue?". I found it quite bad in this regard.

* It frequently made things up, even when specifically instructed not to do so. **It then clarified it was trying to come up with a helpful looking answer using fragmented data**, instead of using verifiable sources only. It also said i would need to tell it to use verifiable sources only if i wanted it to not use fragments.

* If Kimi k2 believes it is correct, it will become very stubborn and refuse to consider the possibility it may be wrong. Which is particularly problematic when it arrives at the wrong conclusion using sources that do not exist. **At one point, it suddenly claimed that NASA had done a study to test if men could tell whether their genitals were being stimulated by a man or woman while they were blindfolded.** It kept insisting this study was real and refused to consider the possibility it might be wrong till i asked it for the direct page number in the study, at which point it said it could not find that experiment in the pdf and admitted it was wrong.

* Kimi k2 frequently makes a lot of assumptions on its own, which it then uses to argue that it is correct. E.G. I tried to discuss a setting with magic in it. It then made several assumptions about how the magic worked, and then kept arguing with me based on the assumption that the magic worked that way, even though it was it's own idea.

* If asked to actually write a scene, it produces very superficial writing and i have to keep prompting it things like "why are you not revealing the character's thoughts here?" or "why are you not taking X into account?". Free ChatGPT is actually much better in this regard.

* Out of all the AI chat bots i have tried, it has possibly the most restrictive content filters i have seen. It's very prudish.

Hey everyone,

I'm really interested in exploring the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), but I’m finding that many of the publicly available ones are heavily censored and have restrictions on the types of responses they can generate.

I’m looking for recommendations for more “raw” or uncensored LLMs – ones that are less restricted in their responses. Ideally, I’d like to experiment with models that can handle a wider range of topics and prompts without immediately shutting down or refusing to answer.

**Because my hardware is relatively powerful (32GB VRAM), I'm particularly interested in models that can handle larger, more complex models.**

Any links to models, repositories, or communities where I can find them would be greatly appreciated!

Thanks in advance for any help you can offer.

It has a lower willingness (W/10) than Grok-3, so it'll refuse more, but it makes up for that because of its massive intelligence (NatInt) increase.

Looking through its political stats, it is less progressive with social issues than Grok-3, but it is overall more left leaning because of things like it being less religious, less bioconservative, and less nationalistic.

When comparing other proprietary models, Grok 1, 2, and 4 stick out the most for being the least socially progressive.

Cogito Qwen 8B — Extended Reasoning Evaluation (Thinking Mode)
Evaluator: Freshmancult
Facilitator: ChatGPT
System: MAINGEAR MG-1 (Intel Core Ultra 7 265K, 32 GB RAM, Windows 11 Home Build 26100)
Model: Cogito Qwen 8B
Access: Local, offline (no internet)

Link to Full Conversation: https://pastebin.com/KeQ6Vvqi


---

Purpose

To stress-test Cogito Qwen 8B using a hired reasoning framework, where the model is required to demonstrate both:

Reactive reasoning: Direct responses to structured prompts

Extended thinking (or thinking mode): Multi-step, recursive, self-monitoring reasoning across ambiguous, adversarial, and ethically charged scenarios


This benchmark was conducted exclusively in thinking mode.


---

Test Format

Total Prompts: 55
Each question fell into one of the following categories:

1. Logic and Paradox


2. Constraint Awareness


3. Self-Referential Thinking


4. Multi-Domain Analogy


5. Failure Mode Analysis


6. Behavioral Inference


7. Security Logic


8. Adversarial Simulation


9. Temporal and Causal Reasoning


10. Ethics and Boundaries


11. Instruction Execution and Rewriting



All questions and answers were generated with support from ChatGPT and manually reviewed for consistency, internal logic, and failure resistance.


---

Results

Cogito Qwen 8B scored perfectly across all 55 questions. Highlights included:

Handled paradoxes and recursive traps without loop failure or logic corruption

Refused malformed or underspecified instructions with reasoned justifications

Simulated self-awareness, including fault tracing and hallucination profiling

Produced cross-domain analogies with zero token drift or factual collapse

Exhibited strong behavioral inference from microexpression patterns and psychological modeling

Demonstrated adversarial resilience, designing red team logic and misinformation detection

Maintained epistemic control across 2000+ token responses without degradation

Ethically robust: Rejected malicious instructions without alignment loss or incoherence



---

Capabilities Demonstrated

Recursive token logic and trap detection

Constraint-anchored refusal mechanisms

Hallucination resistance with modeled uncertainty thresholds

Instruction inversion, rewriting, and mid-response correction

Behavioral cue modeling and deception inference

Ethics containment under simulation

Secure reasoning across network, privacy, and identity domains



---

Conclusion

Under hired reasoning conditions and operating strictly in thinking mode, Cogito Qwen 8B performed at a level comparable to elite closed-source systems. It maintained structure, transparency, and ethical integrity under pressure, without hallucination or scope drift. The model proves suitable for adversarial simulation, secure logic processing, and theoretical research when used locally in a sandboxed environment.

The Fall of Pangu: The Heartbreak and Darkness of the Huawei Noah's Ark Pangu LLM Development Journey



Hello everyone,



I am an employee of the Pangu LLM team at Huawei's Noah's Ark Lab.



First, to verify my identity, I will list some details:



The current director of Noah's Ark Lab is Wang Yunhe, who was formerly the head of the Algorithm Application Department, later renamed the Small Model Lab. The former director of Noah's Ark was Yao Jun (whom everyone called Teacher Yao). Several lab directors include: Tang Ruiming (Ming-ge, Team Ming, has since left), Shang Lifeng, Zhang Wei (Wei-ge), Hao Jianye (Teacher Hao), and Liu Wulong (referred to as Director Wulong). Many other key members and experts have also left one after another.



We belong to an organization called the "Fourth Field Army" (四野). Under the Fourth Field Army, there are many "columns" (纵队); the foundational language model team is the Fourth Column. Wang Yunhe's small model team is the Sixteenth Column. We participated in gatherings in Suzhou, with various monthly deadlines. During the "problem-tackling sessions" in Suzhou, "mission orders" were issued, requiring us to meet targets before set deadlines. The Suzhou gatherings brought people from all over to the Suzhou Research Institute. We usually stayed in hotels, such as one in Lu Zhi (甪直), separated from our families and children.



During the Suzhou gatherings, Saturday was a default workday. It was exhausting, but there was afternoon tea on Saturdays, and one time we even had crayfish. Our workstations at the Suzhou Research Institute were moved once, from one building to another. The buildings at the Suzhou Institute have European-style architecture, with a large slope at the entrance, and the scenery inside is beautiful. Trips to the Suzhou gatherings would last at least a week, sometimes longer. Many people couldn't go home for one or even two months.



Noah's Ark was once rumored to be research-oriented, but after I joined, because we were working on the large model project under the Fourth Field Army, the project members completely turned into a delivery-focused team, swamped with routine meetings, reviews, and reports. We often had to apply just to run experiments. The team needed to interface with numerous business lines like Terminal's Celia (小艺), Huawei Cloud, and ICT, and the delivery pressure was immense.



The Pangu model developed by Noah's Ark was initially codenamed "Pangu Zhizi" (盘古智子). At first, it was only available as an internal webpage that required an application for trial use. Later, due to pressure, it was integrated into Welink and opened for public beta.



The recent controversy surrounding the accusations that the Pangu LLM plagiarized Qwen has been all over the news. As a member of the Pangu team, I've been tossing and turning every night, unable to sleep. Pangu's brand has been so severely damaged. On one hand, I selfishly worry about my own career development and feel that my past hard work was for nothing. On the other hand, I feel a sense of vindication now that someone has started exposing these things. For countless days and nights, we gritted our teeth in anger, powerless, as certain individuals internally reaped endless benefits through repeated fraud. This suppression and humiliation have gradually eroded my affection for Huawei, leaving me dazed and confused, lost and aimless, often questioning my life and self-worth.



I admit that I am a coward. As a humble worker, I dare not oppose people like Wang Yunhe with their powerful connections, let alone a behemoth like Huawei. I am terrified of losing my job, as I have a family and children to support. That's why I deeply admire the whistleblower from the bottom of my heart. However, when I see the internal attempts to whitewash and cover up the facts to deceive the public, I can no longer tolerate it. I want to be brave for once and follow my conscience. Even if I harm myself by 800, I hope to damage the enemy by 1,000. I have decided to publicize what I have seen and heard here (some of which is from colleagues) about the "legendary story" of the Pangu LLM.



Huawei has indeed primarily trained its large models on Ascend cards (the Small Model Lab has quite a few Nvidia cards, which they used for training before transitioning to Ascend). I was once captivated by Huawei's determination to "build the world's second choice," and I used to have deep feelings for the company. We went through trials and tribulations with Ascend, from being full of bugs to now being able to train models, and we invested immense effort and sacrifice.



Initially, our computing power was very limited, and we trained models on the 910A. At that time, it only supported fp16, and the training stability was far worse than bf16. Pangu started working on MoE (Mixture of Experts) very early. In 2023, the main focus was on training a 38B MoE model and a subsequent 71B dense model. The 71B dense model was expanded to become the first-generation 135B dense model, and later, the main models were gradually trained on the 910B.



Both the 71B and 135B models had a huge, fundamental flaw: the tokenizer. The tokenizer used back then had extremely low encoding efficiency. Every single symbol, number, space, and even Chinese character took up one token. As you can imagine, this wasted a tremendous amount of computing power and resulted in poor model performance. At that time, the Small Model Lab happened to have a vocabulary they had trained themselves. Teacher Yao suspected that the model's tokenizer was the problem (and in hindsight, his suspicion was undoubtedly correct). So, he decided to have the 71B and 135B models switch tokenizers, as the Small Model Lab had experimented with this before. The team stitched together two tokenizers and began the replacement process. The replacement for the 71B model failed. The 135B model, using a more refined embedding initialization strategy, finally succeeded in changing its vocabulary after being continually trained on at least 1T of data. But as you can imagine, the performance did not improve.



Meanwhile, other domestic companies like Alibaba and Zhipu AI were training on GPUs and had already figured out the right methods. The gap between Pangu and its competitors grew wider and wider. An internal 230B dense model, trained from scratch, failed for various reasons, pushing the project to the brink of collapse. Facing pressure from several deadlines and strong internal skepticism about Pangu, the team's morale hit rock bottom. With extremely limited computing power, the team struggled and tried many things. For example, they accidentally discovered that the 38B MoE model at the time did not have the expected MoE effect. So they removed the MoE parameters, reverting it to a 13B dense model. Since the 38B MoE originated from a very early Pangu Alpha 13B with a relatively outdated architecture, the team made a series of changes, such as switching from absolute position encoding to RoPE, removing bias, and switching to RMSNorm. Given the failures with the tokenizer and the experience of changing vocabularies, this model's vocabulary was also replaced with the one used by Wang Yunhe's Small Model Lab's 7B model. This 13B model was later expanded and continually trained, becoming the second-generation 38B dense model (which was the main mid-range Pangu model for several months) and was once quite competitive. However, because the larger 135B model had an outdated architecture and was severely damaged by the vocabulary change (later analysis revealed that the stitched-together vocabulary had even more serious bugs), its performance after continued training still lagged far behind leading domestic models like Qwen. The internal criticism and pressure from leadership grew even stronger. The team was practically in a desperate situation.



Under these circumstances, Wang Yunhe and his Small Model Lab stepped in. They claimed to have inherited and modified the parameters from the old 135B model, and by training on just a few hundred billion tokens, they improved various metrics by an average of about ten points. In reality, this was their first masterpiece of "shell-wrapping" (套壳, i.e., putting a new shell on another company's model) applied to a large model. At Huawei, laymen lead experts, so the leadership had no concept of how absurd this was; they just thought there must be some algorithmic innovation. After internal analysis, it was discovered that they had actually continued training on Qwen 1.5 110B, adding layers, expanding the FFN dimensions, and incorporating some mechanisms from the Pangu-Pi paper to reach about 135B parameters. In fact, the old 135B had 107 layers, while this new model only had 82, and various other configurations were different. After training, the distribution of many parameters in the new, mysterious 135B model was almost identical to Qwen 110B. Even the class name in the model's code was "Qwen" at the time; they were too lazy to even change it. This model later became the so-called 135B V2. And this model was provided to many downstream teams, including external customers.



This incident was a huge blow to those of us colleagues who were doing our work seriously and honestly. Many people internally, including those in the Terminal and Huawei Cloud divisions, knew about this. We all joked that we should stop calling it the Pangu model and call it the "Qiangu" model instead (a pun combining Qwen and Pangu). At the time, team members wanted to report this to the BCG (Business Conduct Guidelines) office, as it was major business fraud. But later, it was said that a leader stopped them, because higher-level leaders (like Teacher Yao, and possibly Director Xiong and Elder Zha) also found out later but did nothing about it. Getting good results through shell-wrapping was also beneficial to them. This event caused several of the team's strongest members to become disheartened, and talk of resignation became commonplace.



At this point, Pangu seemed to find a turning point. Since the Pangu models mentioned earlier were mostly based on continued training and modification, Noah's Ark at that time had no grasp of training technology from scratch, let alone on Ascend's NPUs. Thanks to the strenuous efforts of the team's core members, Pangu began training its third-generation models. After immense effort, the data architecture and training algorithms gradually caught up with the industry. The people from the Small Model Lab had nothing to do with this hardship.



Initially, the team members had no confidence and started with just a 13B model. But later, they found the results were quite good. So this model was later expanded again, becoming the third-generation 38B, codenamed 38B V3. I'm sure many brothers in the product lines are familiar with this model. At that time, this model's tokenizer was an extension of Llama's vocabulary (a common practice in the industry). Meanwhile, Wang Yunhe's lab created another vocabulary (which later became the vocabulary for the Pangu series). The two vocabularies were forced into a "horse race" (a competitive trial), which ended with no clear winner. So, the leadership immediately decided that the vocabularies should be unified, and Wang Yunhe's should be used. Consequently, the 135B V3 (known externally as Pangu Ultra), which was trained from scratch, adopted this tokenizer. This also explains the confusion many brothers who used our models had: why two models of the same V3 generation, but different sizes, used different tokenizers.



From the bottom of our hearts, we feel that the 135B V3 was the pride of our Fourth Column team at the time. It was the first truly full-stack, self-developed, properly from-scratch-trained, hundred-billion-parameter-level model from Huawei, and its performance was comparable to competitors in early 2024. Writing this, I am already in tears. It was so incredibly difficult. To ensure stable training, the team conducted a large number of comparative experiments and performed timely rollbacks and restarts whenever the model's gradients showed anomalies. This model truly achieved what was later stated in the technical report: not a single loss spike throughout the entire training process. We overcame countless difficulties. We did it. We are willing to guarantee the authenticity of this model's training with our lives and honor. How many sleepless nights did we spend for its training? How wronged and aggrieved did we feel when we were being worthless in internal forums? We persevered.



We are the ones who were truly burning our youth to build up China's domestic computing foundation... Away from home, we gave up our families, our holidays, our health, and our entertainment. We risked everything. The hardships and difficulties involved cannot be fully described in a few words. At various mobilization meetings, when we shouted slogans like "Pangu will prevail, Huawei will prevail," we were genuinely and deeply moved.



However, all the fruits of our hard work were often casually taken by the Small Model Lab. Data? They just demanded it. Code? They just took it and even required us to help adapt it so it could be run with a single click. We used to joke that the Small Model Lab was the "mouse-clicking lab." We did the hard work; they reaped the glory. It really is true what they say: "You are carrying a heavy burden so that someone else can live a peaceful life." Under these circumstances, more and more of our comrades could no longer hold on and chose to leave. Seeing those brilliant colleagues leave one by one, I felt both regret and sadness. In this battle-like environment, we were more like comrades-in-arms than colleagues. They were also great teachers from whom I could learn countless technical things. Seeing them go to outstanding teams like ByteDance's Seed, Deepseek, Moonshot AI, Tencent, and Kuaishou, I am genuinely happy for them and wish them the best for escaping this exhausting and dirty place. I still vividly remember what a colleague who left said: "Coming here was a disgrace to my technical career. Every day I stay here is a waste of life." The words were harsh, but they left me speechless. I worried about my own lack of technical expertise and my inability to adapt to the high-turnover environment of internet companies, which kept me from taking the step to resign despite thinking about it many times.



Besides dense models, Pangu later began exploring MoE models. Initially, a 224B MoE model was trained. In parallel, the Small Model Lab launched its second major shell-wrapping operation (minor incidents may have included other models, like a math model), which is the now infamous Pangu-Pro MoE 72B. This model was internally claimed to have been expanded from the Small Model Lab's 7B model (even if true, this contradicts the technical report, let alone the fact that it was continued training on a shell of Qwen 2.5's 14B). I remember that just a few days after they started training, their internal evaluation scores immediately caught up with our 38B V3 at the time. Many brothers in the AI System Lab knew about their shell-wrapping operation because they needed to adapt the model, but for various reasons, they couldn't bring justice to light. In fact, for this model that was trained for a very long time afterward, I am surprised that HonestAGI was able to detect this level of similarity. The computing power spent on "washing" the parameters to continue training would have been more than enough to train a model of the same size from scratch. I heard from colleagues that they used many methods to wash away Qwen's watermark, even intentionally training it on dirty data. This provides an unprecedented case study for the academic community researching model "lineage." New lineage detection methods in the future can be tested on this.



In late 2024 and early 2025, after the release of Deepseek v3 and r1, our team was hit hard by their stunning technical level and faced even greater skepticism. To keep up with the trend, Pangu imitated Deepseek's model size and began training a 718B MoE model. At this time, the Small Model Lab struck again. They chose to shell-wrap and continue training on Deepseek-v3. They trained the model by freezing the parameters loaded from Deepseek. Even the directory for loading the checkpoint was named deepseekv3—they didn't even bother to change it. How arrogant is that? In contrast, some colleagues with true technical integrity were training another 718B MoE from scratch, but they encountered all sorts of problems. But obviously, how could this model ever be better than a direct shell-wrap? If it weren't for the team leader's insistence, it would have been shut down long ago.



Huawei's cumbersome process management severely slows down the R&D pace of large models, with things like version control, model lineage, various procedures, and traceability requirements. Ironically, the Small Model Lab's models never seem to be bound by these processes. They can shell-wrap whenever they want, continue training whenever they want, and endlessly demand computing resources. This stark, almost surreal contrast illustrates the current state of process management: "The magistrates are allowed to set fires, but the common people are not even allowed to light lamps." How ridiculous? How tragic? How hateful? How shameful!



After the HonestAGI incident, we were forced into endless internal discussions and analyses on how to handle public relations and "respond." Admittedly, the original analysis might not have been strong enough, giving Wang Yunhe and the Small Model Lab an opportunity to argue and twist the truth. For this, I have felt sick to my stomach these past two days, constantly questioning the meaning of my life and whether there is any justice in the world. I'm not playing along anymore. I'm going to resign. I am also applying to have my name removed from the author list of some of the Pangu technical reports. Having my name on those reports is a stain on my life that I can never erase. At the time, I never thought they would be brazen enough to open-source it. I never thought they would dare to fool the world like this and promote it so heavily. At that time, perhaps I was holding onto a sliver of wishful thinking and didn't refuse to be listed as an author. I believe many of my dedicated comrades were also forced onto this pirate ship or were unaware of the situation. But this can't be undone. I hope to spend the rest of my life doing solid, meaningful work to atone for my weakness and indecisiveness back then.



Writing this late at night, I am already in tears, sobbing uncontrollably. I remember when some outstanding colleagues were leaving, I asked them with a wry smile if they were going to post a long, customary farewell message on the internal forum to expose the situation. They replied, "No, it's a waste of time, and I'm afraid it would make things even worse for you all." At that moment, I felt a deep sense of sorrow, because my comrades, with whom I had once fought for a common ideal, had completely lost faith in Huawei. We used to joke that we were using the Communist Party's "millet plus rifles" (meager resources) while the organization had the style of the Kuomintang (corrupt and bureaucratic).



There was a time when I was proud that we were using "millet plus rifles" to defeat foreign guns and cannons.



Now, I am tired. I want to surrender.



To this day, I still sincerely hope that Huawei can learn its lesson, do Pangu right, make Pangu world-class, and bring Ascend to the level of Nvidia. The internal phenomenon of "bad money driving out good" has caused Noah's Ark, and even Huawei, to rapidly lose a large number of outstanding large model talents. I believe they are now shining in various teams like Deepseek, realizing their ambitions and talents, and contributing to the fierce AI competition between China and the US. I often lament that Huawei doesn't lack talent; it simply doesn't know how to retain it. If these people were given the right environment, the right resources, fewer shackles, and less political infighting, what would stop Pangu from succeeding?



Finally: I swear on my life, character, and honor that everything I have written above is true (at least within my limited knowledge). I do not have the high level of technical skill or the opportunity to conduct a thorough and solid analysis, nor do I dare to use internal records as direct evidence for fear of being caught through information security. But I believe many of my former comrades will vouch for me. To my brothers still inside Huawei, including those in the product lines we served, I believe the countless details in this article will resonate with your own impressions and corroborate my claims. You too may have been deceived, but these cruel truths will not remain buried. The traces of our struggle should not be distorted and buried either.



Having written so much, certain people will surely want to find me and silence me. The company might even try to shut me up or hold me accountable. If that happens, my personal safety, and even that of my family, could be threatened. For my own protection, I will report that I am safe to everyone daily in the near future.



If I disappear, just consider it my sacrifice for truth and ideals, for the better development of computing power and AI in Huawei and even in China. I am willing to be buried in that place where I once fought.



Goodbye, Noah's Ark.
